# Emergence
undergrad thesis on the emergence of multi-agent behaviours 


# Work Roadmap 

## Stage 0 

- literature review
- reproduce rl, marl, language+rl works 
- checkout available environments/simulators 


### multi-agent works 
- MADDPG 
- COMA 
- DIAL 
- CommNet


## Stage 1 

- easy cooperative, competitve and communication multi-agent behaviors 
- learn to interact for more efficient task solving 
student-teacher framework 
2 goals: task solving & being a good teacher 



## Stage 2 

behavior change of protecting eggs is very powerful in terms of evoluation 
need adversarial agents 
need to set the constraint just right and conditions complex enough 
learning constraints automatically? from demonstrations? 


## Stage 3
